## Instructions for Demonstrating Locally
- Download the repo
- Keep ports 3000 and 8080 free, as the frontend and backend use these respectively
- Run `docker-compose up -d --build` in the project root
- Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser window
- Use an incognito window or different browser to simulate a conversation
    - **This is important as each user needs their own cookies**
- Use as you would use the online version
